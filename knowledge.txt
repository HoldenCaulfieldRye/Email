MUA:
mail user agent.
aka email client.
a computer program used to access and manage a user's email.


SMTP:
simple mail transfer protocol.
a protocol for a MUA to send data to a MSA.


MSA:
mail submission agent.
a computer program that receives emails from a MUA and cooperates with
a MTA for delivery of the mail.
MSA and MTA are separate so that only one, MSA, can interact with MUA.
MSA can correct minor errors in email's format, report major errors to
MUA. MTA cannot do this quickly and reliably because of some functions
it performs.


MTA:
mail transfer agent.
a computer program that locates target host, aka MX target.
1) uses the Domain Name System to look up the Mail Exchanger record
   for the recipient's domain. the returned MX record contains name
   of target host. 
2) then, connects to the exchange server as an SMTP client.


MX:
mail exchanger, aka mail exchange server.
sends email to a MDA.


MDA:
mail delivery agent, aka Local Delivery Agent.
1) a computer program that is responsible for the delivery of e-mail
   messages to a local recipient's mailbox, aka local mail server,
   via Local Email Transfer Protocol for desktop MUA, via SMTP for webmail.
2) saves messages in relevant mailbox format.
